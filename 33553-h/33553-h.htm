Introduction
</H3>

<P CLASS="noindent">
Most of the poems contained in this collection are of recent date,
though their author&mdash;who is at present Professor of Modern Languages at
Bishop's College, Quebec&mdash;has written verse from his childhood.  He is
the first Canadian writer to be included in this series, and is as
affectionately loyal to the Motherland as to his native country, as may
be gathered from his "Song of the Homeland."  His verse has already
earned a considerable reputation in Canada, in whose Press much of it
has appeared.  Educated at Stanstead College, he took his degree at the
University where he now lectures, and has also studied in Paris,
Marburg and Switzerland.  Several of his poems are concerned with the
sorrow and the ravished beauty of Belgium: a circumstance not
surprising, as he has travelled much in that country, as well as in
France, Switzerland and Italy.  A lover of country life and a disciple
of the cult of the open road, he revels in the joys of camping and
canoeing, as one of his poems, "Hidden Treasure," bears witness.  In
this little book, and more especially in the "Song of the Homeland," he
shows us the maple leaf entwined, strongly as ever, with the English
rose of the Mother country.

<P CLASS="poem">
Once in a Belgian garden,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">(Ah, many months ago!)</SPAN><BR>
I saw like pale Madonnas<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The tall white lilies blow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Great poplars swayed and trembled<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Afar against the sky,</SPAN><BR>
And green with flags and rushes<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The river wandered by.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Amid the waving wheatfields<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Glowed poppies blazing red,</SPAN><BR>
And showering strange wild music<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A lark rose overhead.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 10%; letter-spacing: 2em">*****</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The lark has ceased his singing,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The wheat is trodden low,</SPAN><BR>
And in the blood-stained garden<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No more the lilies blow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And where green poplars trembled<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Stand shattered trunks instead,</SPAN><BR>
And lines of small white crosses<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Keep guard above the dead.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For here brave lads and noble,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">From lands beyond the deep,</SPAN><BR>
Beneath the small white crosses<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Have laid them down to sleep.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They laid them down with gladness<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Upon the alien plain,</SPAN><BR>
That this same Belgian garden<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Might bud and bloom again.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Long the eastern beaches,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Where brown the seaweed grows,</SPAN><BR>
And over broad salt meadows,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The green tide ebbs and flows.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Above the low-roofed houses,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Two ancient towers rise,</SPAN><BR>
And stand like giant druids,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Against the wind-swept skies.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through mist or rain or sunshine,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Their prows festooned with foam,</SPAN><BR>
The fishing-boats go outward<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Or laden, turn them home.</SPAN><BR>

She watches by the window,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And tearless are her eyes;</SPAN><BR>
She sees not church or tower,<BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She sees not tide or tempest,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Or sun or mist or rain;</SPAN><BR>
Afar her spirit wanders<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Upon the Belgian plain.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where over shell-scarred cities<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The mad, red tempest raves,</SPAN><BR>
And poplars sigh and shudder<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Above unnumbered graves.</SPAN><BR>

Hidden Treasure<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Sun-browned boy with the wondering eyes,<BR>
Do you see the blue of the summer skies?<BR>
Do you hear the song of the drowsy stream,<BR>
As it winds by the shore where the birches gleam?<BR>
Then come, come away<BR>
From the shadowy bay,<BR>
And we'll drift with the stream where the rapids play;<BR>
For we are two pirates, fierce and bold,<BR>
And we'll capture the hoard of the morning's gold.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A roving craft is our red canoe,<BR>
O pirate chief with the eyes of blue;<BR>
So hoist your flag with the skull on high,<BR>
And out we'll sail where the treasures lie.<BR>
For in days of old<BR>
Came pirates bold,<BR>
a Spanish galleon's captured gold;<BR>
And their boat was wrecked on the river strand<BR>
And its treasures strewn on the silver sand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now steady all as we dash along,<BR>
The rapids are swift but our paddles are strong;<BR>
And soon we'll drift with the water's flow<BR>
Where the treasure lies hid in the shallows below,<BR>
Oh, cool and dim,<BR>
'Neath its foam-flecked brim,<BR>
Is the pool where the swallows dip and skim;<BR>
So we'll plunge by the prow of our red canoe<BR>
For the treasure that lies in the quivering blue.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now home once more to the shadowy bay,<BR>
For we've captured the gold of the summer's day,<BR>
And emeralds green from the banks along,<BR>
And the silver bars of the white-throat's song.<BR>
No pirates bore<BR>
Such a glittering store<BR>
From the treasure ships of the days of yore,<BR>
As the spoils we have won on the shining stream,<BR>
While we drifted along in a golden dream.<BR>
</P>

A River Sunset<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Red sunlight fades from wood and town,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The western sky is crimson-dyed,</SPAN><BR>
Gaunt shadow-ships drift silent down<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Upon the river's gleaming tide.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The hills' clear outlines melt away<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Or veil themselves in purple light,</SPAN><BR>
And burning thoughts that vexed the day<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Become fair visions of the night.</SPAN><BR>

The Madonna<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
She shivered and crouched in the immigrant shed<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">In the midst of the surging crowd;</SPAN><BR>
Her hands were warped with the years of toil,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And her young form bent and bowed.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Her eyes looked forth with a frightened glance<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">At the throng that round her pressed;</SPAN><BR>
But her face was the face of the Mother of God<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">As she looked at the babe on her breast.</SPAN><BR>

An Idol in a Shop Window<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Old Lohan peers through the dusty glass,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">From a jumble of curios quaint and rare;</SPAN><BR>
And he watches the hurrying crowds that pass<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The whole day long, through the ancient square.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wrapped in his robe of gold and jade,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Here by the window he patiently waits</SPAN><BR>
For the sound that the gongs and the conches made,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">In the days of old at the temple gates.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He heaves no sighs and he sheds no tears,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">For his heart is bronze, and he does not know</SPAN><BR>
That his temple has been for a thousand years<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">But a mound of dust where the bamboos grow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So here he sits through the nights and days,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the sun goes up and down the sky;</SPAN><BR>
But he often looks with a wistful gaze<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">At the crowds that always pass him by.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And his eyes half closed in a mystic dream<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of his poppy-land of long ago,</SPAN><BR>
Turn back to the shores of the sacred stream<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the kneeling throng he used to know.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But he sometimes smiles as he sees the crowd<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of human folk that pass him by;</SPAN><BR>
Then he wraps himself in his mystic shroud,&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the sun once more goes down the sky.</SPAN><BR>

Through a Long Cloister<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through a long cloister where the gloom of night<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Lingers in sombre silence all the day,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Across worn pavements crumbling to decay</SPAN><BR>
We wandered, blindly groping for the light.<BR>
A door swung wide, and splendour infinite<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Streamed through the painted glass, and drove away</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The lingering gloom from choir, nave and bay,</SPAN><BR>
And a great minster's glory met our sight.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Blindly along life's cloister do we grope,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">We seek a gate that leads to life immortal,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">We see it loom before us dim and vast,</SPAN><BR>
And doubt's dark shadows veil the light of hope:<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">When lo, Death's hand flings wide the sombre portal,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">And light unfading meets our gaze at last.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">My son and I had left St. Jean,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Our paddles dipping in the blue,</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Along the silent Richelieu;</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The night came down, we thought of rest;</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A threatening cloud hung in the west.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No warning sound the river made</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">We camped upon that luckless shore;</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">When o'er the waters black and chill</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">We saw a ghastly, gleaming light,&mdash;-</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A fitful fire, pale and blue,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">That burned my inmost spirit through.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And like some baleful gleaming eye</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">It shone beneath night's heavy pall;</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Then high above the loon's lone cry</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Afar we heard the spirit call;</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">It called us from the other shore.</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Ah, Jean will never hear it more!</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Held me beside my own canoe,</SPAN><BR>

The snowflakes fell on a mountain peak,<BR>
Where the rocks were bare and the winds were bleak,<BR>
And at first they clung to the mountain's breast,<BR>
But soon they fell from its lofty crest,<BR>
And stained and soiled was the new-born snow<BR>
When it reached the valley far down below.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But up on the height one drift alone<BR>
Still firmly clung to the rugged stone,<BR>
And men in the gloomy vale below<BR>
Looked up and gazed on the shining snow,<BR>
And their darkened souls drank in the light<BR>
From the gleaming snow on the mountain height.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Unstained by the grime of the earthly vale,<BR>
Its white breast firm in the strongest gale,<BR>
It bravely clung to its lofty height<BR>
And gleamed afar with its glorious light,<BR>
Till kissed by the sun and the summer rain,<BR>
It rose in mist to the skies again.<BR>

And higher and higher up rocky height,<BR>

Its gates of pearl, its streets of shining gold,&mdash;<BR>

The strand of primrose bloom, the water's flow,<BR>
Mingled with thy sweet voice in music low,<BR>
The angel song; to touch my lips to thine,<BR>
To hear the whispering of thy heart to mine,<BR>
And burning with a fire that never dies,<BR>
To see once more the love-light in thine eyes.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The waters of the river gleamed as brightly<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And murmured with the same untiring flow,</SPAN><BR>
The branches of the birches tossed as lightly,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Among them sang the breeze as soft and low,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 4em">A year ago.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We sat beneath the white-stemmed birches bending<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">To reach the gurgling waters of the bay,</SPAN><BR>
We saw the boats their courses seaward wending,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And earth seemed fair,&mdash;before us life's long day,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 4em">Night far away.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But often clouds would veil the sunlight over,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A moment cast a shadow and float by;</SPAN><BR>
So stealthily above our hearts would hover<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Sad thoughts to pause a moment, pass and die,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 4em">We knew not why.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We heeded not the moaning of the river,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Nor did the wind a whispered message bring;</SPAN><BR>
Ah, now I know they murmured&mdash;part forever!<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">For that dull gloom above us hovering,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 4em">Was Death's dark wing.</SPAN><BR>

Pierce through the fogs and know thy mystery.<BR>
Voiceless thou art and voiceless wilt thou be,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Across thy still, cold deeps there comes no light,</SPAN><BR>

I can hear it calling, calling, sounding on the morning breeze,<BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">But alas, I know for me it calls no more.</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Ah, how sweet the memory lingers!</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Though old Time's relentless fingers</SPAN><BR>
Oft have turned the glass while flowed the sands away,<BR>

I can see the gleaming river 'mid the willows winding blue,<BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Laggard footsteps, scarcely creeping,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">To the bell's low tolling keeping</SPAN><BR>
Measured tread, as oft before my own have done;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Ah, the longing ceasing never</SPAN><BR>

And to-day I count the gains that I have won!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I can hear it calling, calling, though its tongue no longer swings,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">For within my heart its notes are ringing free,</SPAN><BR>
As with silent step before me, Memory the old scene brings<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And I think the old bell's voice is calling me.</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Then I see the old loved faces</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Grouped about their wonted places,</SPAN><BR>
As the boyish voices chant their song of praise;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Gone all thought of joy or sorrow,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Loss to-day or gain to-morrow,</SPAN><BR>
And I live again the life of other days.<BR>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
